## Lesson 1: Introduction to Monocular Depth Estimation with Vision Transformers

In this lesson, we'll introduce monocular depth estimation and how Vision Transformers (ViTs) can be used for dense prediction tasks.

**Note:** We start by importing the necessary libraries for handling images and tensors.

```python
import torch
from torchvision import transforms
from PIL import Image
```

**Note:** Load an image and preprocess it to fit the input requirements of a Vision Transformer (ViT). We resize the image to 384x384 and normalize it.

```python
image = Image.open('path_to_image.jpg')
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((384, 384)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize([0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5])
])
input_tensor = transform(image).unsqueeze(0)
```

**Note:** We load a pre-trained ViT model using the `timm` library. The model is set to evaluation mode. This ViT model will serve as our backbone for feature extraction.

```python
from timm import create_model

vit_model = create_model('vit_base_patch16_384', pretrained=True)
vit_model.eval()
```

**Note:** Extract features from the input image using the ViT model. This step outputs a feature map that will be used for depth estimation.

```python
with torch.no_grad():
    features = vit_model.forward_features(input_tensor)
```

**Note:** Inspect the shape of the extracted features. Understanding the feature dimensions is crucial for building subsequent layers.

```python
print(features.shape)
```

## Lesson 2: Building a Multi-Scale ViT Encoder

In this lesson, we'll build a multi-scale encoder that processes the image at multiple scales to capture both global context and fine details.

**Note:** Define a function to create an image pyramid at different scales. This helps in processing the image at various resolutions.

```python
def create_pyramid(image, scales):
    return [image.resize((int(image.width * scale), int(image.height * scale))) for scale in scales]
```

**Note:** Create an image pyramid using the defined scales. This will generate multiple versions of the image at different resolutions.

```python
scales = [1.0, 0.5, 0.25]
image_pyramid = create_pyramid(image, scales)
```

**Note:** Preprocess each image in the pyramid to create input tensors suitable for the ViT model.

```python
inputs = [transform(im).unsqueeze(0) for im in image_pyramid]
```

**Note:** Pass each scaled image through the ViT model to extract features at multiple scales, capturing both global context and local details.

```python
with torch.no_grad():
    features_list = [vit_model.forward_features(inp) for inp in inputs]
```

**Note:** Print out the shape of the features at each scale to understand how the resolution affects the feature dimensions.

```python
for idx, features in enumerate(features_list):
    print(f"Scale {scales[idx]}: features shape {features.shape}")
```

**Note:** Define a function to resize feature maps to a common spatial resolution for further processing.

```python
# Upsample or downsample features as needed
def resize_features(features, target_size):
    return torch.nn.functional.interpolate(features, size=target_size, mode='bilinear', align_corners=False)
```

## Lesson 3: Implementing the Decoder and Depth Prediction Head

This lesson focuses on decoding the multi-scale features and implementing the depth prediction head to generate the depth map.

**Note:** Implement a simple feature fusion module that combines features from different scales. This is inspired by the decoder architecture described in Section 3.1 of the paper.

```python
class FeatureFusionModule(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = torch.nn.Conv2d(input_channels, input_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = torch.nn.ReLU()
        self.conv2 = torch.nn.Conv2d(input_channels, input_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
    
    def forward(self, x_high, x_low):
        x_low_upsampled = torch.nn.functional.interpolate(x_low, size=x_high.shape[-2:], mode='bilinear', align_corners=False)
        x = x_high + x_low_upsampled
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        return x
```

**Note:** Initialize the decoder with the appropriate number of input channels matching the ViT model's output.

```python
decoder = FeatureFusionModule(input_channels=768)
```

**Note:** Fuse features from the highest and mid-level scales. This combines global context with local details.

```python
fused_features = decoder(features_list[0], features_list[1])
```

**Note:** Define the depth prediction head that converts fused features into a single-channel depth map.

```python
depth_head = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Conv2d(768, 256, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
    torch.nn.ReLU(),
    torch.nn.Conv2d(256, 1, kernel_size=1)
)
```

**Note:** Generate the depth map by passing the fused features through the depth prediction head.

```python
depth_map = depth_head(fused_features)
```

**Note:** Verify the dimensions of the predicted depth map.

```python
print(f"Depth map shape: {depth_map.shape}")
```

## Lesson 4: Training with Boundary-Aware Loss Functions

In this lesson, we'll implement loss functions that focus on producing sharp depth boundaries, enhancing edge details in the depth map.

**Note:** Compute the gradient of the depth map in the x-direction. This helps in capturing horizontal edge information.

```python
def gradient_x(img):
    gx = img[:, :, :, :-1] - img[:, :, :, 1:]
    return gx
```

**Note:** Compute the gradient of the depth map in the y-direction to capture vertical edge information.

```python
def gradient_y(img):
    gy = img[:, :, :-1, :] - img[:, :, 1:, :]
    return gy
```

**Note:** Implement a depth smoothness loss function that penalizes depth gradients weighted by image gradients, as discussed in Section 3.2 of the paper. This encourages the depth map to have sharp edges aligned with image edges.

```python
def depth_smoothness_loss(predicted_depth, image):
    pred_dx = gradient_x(predicted_depth)
    pred_dy = gradient_y(predicted_depth)
    img_dx = gradient_x(image)
    img_dy = gradient_y(image)
    weights_x = torch.exp(-torch.mean(torch.abs(img_dx), 1, keepdim=True))
    weights_y = torch.exp(-torch.mean(torch.abs(img_dy), 1, keepdim=True))
    smoothness_x = pred_dx * weights_x
    smoothness_y = pred_dy * weights_y
    return smoothness_x.abs().mean() + smoothness_y.abs().mean()
```

**Note:** Define a Laplacian loss to enforce second-order smoothness in the depth predictions, helping to preserve fine details and sharp edges.

```python
def laplacian_loss(predicted_depth, target_depth):
    laplace_kernel = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 0], [1, -4, 1], [0, 1, 0]]).unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0).to(predicted_depth.device)
    pred_laplace = torch.nn.functional.conv2d(predicted_depth, laplace_kernel, padding=1)
    target_laplace = torch.nn.functional.conv2d(target_depth, laplace_kernel, padding=1)
    return torch.mean((pred_laplace - target_laplace) ** 2)
```

**Note:** Combine the smoothness and Laplacian losses to train the network. This encourages the model to produce depth maps with sharp boundaries and fine details.

```python
# Example usage during training
loss = depth_smoothness_loss(depth_map, input_tensor) + laplacian_loss(depth_map, ground_truth_depth)
```

## Lesson 5: Implementing Boundary Evaluation Metrics and Focal Length Estimation

In the final lesson, we'll implement evaluation metrics for boundary accuracy and add a focal length estimation module to predict focal length from the image.

**Note:** Implement precision and recall calculation for depth boundaries. This metric evaluates how well the predicted depth edges align with the ground truth, as introduced in Section 3.2.

```python
def boundary_precision_recall(predicted_depth, ground_truth_depth, threshold):
    depth_edges = torch.abs(torch.nn.functional.conv2d(predicted_depth, laplace_kernel, padding=1)) > threshold
    gt_edges = torch.abs(torch.nn.functional.conv2d(ground_truth_depth, laplace_kernel, padding=1)) > threshold
    true_positives = (depth_edges & gt_edges).float().sum()
    predicted_positives = depth_edges.float().sum()
    actual_positives = gt_edges.float().sum()
    precision = true_positives / (predicted_positives + 1e-6)
    recall = true_positives / (actual_positives + 1e-6)
    return precision, recall
```

**Note:** Compute and display the boundary precision and recall values.

```python
precision, recall = boundary_precision_recall(depth_map, ground_truth_depth, threshold=0.1)
print(f"Boundary Precision: {precision.item():.4f}, Recall: {recall.item():.4f}")
```

**Note:** Implement a focal length (Field of View) estimator using the ViT encoder. This module predicts the focal length from the image itself, as described in Section 3.3.

```python
class FOVEstimator(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = vit_model  # Use the same ViT encoder
        self.fc = torch.nn.Linear(768, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        features = self.encoder.forward_features(x)
        global_feature = features.mean(dim=1)  # Global average pooling
        fov = self.fc(global_feature)
        return fov
```

**Note:** Estimate the field of view from the input image. This value can be used to scale the depth predictions appropriately.

```python
fov_estimator = FOVEstimator()
fov = fov_estimator(input_tensor)
print(f"Estimated FOV (degrees): {fov.item():.2f}")
```

**Note:** Convert the canonical inverse depth map to metric depth using the estimated focal length and the image width, following the equation from Section 3.3: $$D_m = \frac{f_{px}}{w \cdot C}$$

```python
def metric_depth(canonical_inverse_depth, fov, image_width):
    focal_length = 0.5 * image_width / torch.tan(0.5 * torch.deg2rad(fov))
    depth = focal_length / canonical_inverse_depth
    return depth
```

**Note:** Compute the metric depth map using the estimated FOV and the canonical inverse depth map.

```python
metric_depth_map = metric_depth(1 / depth_map, fov, image_width=input_tensor.shape[-1])
```
