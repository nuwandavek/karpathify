## Lesson 1: Introduction to Monocular Depth Estimation

In this lesson, we'll explore the basics of monocular depth estimation using a simple pre-trained model. We'll understand how depth can be inferred from a single image using neural networks.

**Note:** # Setting up the environment
We start by importing the necessary libraries: `torch` for tensor computations, `torchvision.transforms` for image preprocessing, `PIL` for image handling, and `matplotlib` for visualization.

```python
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

**Note:** # Loading a pre-trained depth estimation model
We load the MiDaS_small model from PyTorch Hub, which is a lightweight model for monocular depth estimation.

```python
model = torch.hub.load('intel-isl/MiDaS', 'MiDaS_small')
model.eval()
```

**Note:** # Defining the image transformation
We define a transformation pipeline to resize the input image, convert it to a tensor, and normalize it. This is essential to prepare the image for the model.

```python
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(
        mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
        std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    )
])
```

**Note:** # Preprocessing the input image
We load the input image and apply the transformation to get it ready for depth estimation.

```python
img = Image.open('input.jpg')
input_tensor = transform(img).unsqueeze(0)
```

**Note:** # Performing depth estimation
We pass the preprocessed image to the model to get the depth map. We use `torch.no_grad()` to disable gradient calculations since we are in inference mode.

```python
with torch.no_grad():
    depth = model(input_tensor)
    depth = depth.squeeze().cpu().numpy()
```

**Note:** # Visualizing the depth map
Finally, we visualize the estimated depth map using matplotlib.

```python
plt.imshow(depth)
plt.show()
```

## Lesson 2: Building an Efficient Multi-Scale ViT-based Architecture

In this lesson, we'll implement a simple multi-scale Vision Transformer (ViT) based encoder. We'll learn how multi-scale processing helps in capturing both global context and fine details.

**Note:** # Importing PyTorch modules
We need `torch` and `torch.nn` to build neural network components.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
```

**Note:** # Defining the MultiScaleViTEncoder class
We create a class for our multi-scale ViT encoder. This encoder creates patch embeddings from the image and processes them using a Transformer encoder.

Refer to **Section 3.1** of the paper where they discuss the multi-scale ViT-based architecture.

```python
class MultiScaleViTEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, img_size=224, patch_size=16, embed_dim=768):
        super().__init__()
        self.img_size = img_size
        self.patch_size = patch_size
        self.embed_dim = embed_dim
        self.num_patches = (img_size // patch_size) ** 2

        self.patch_embeddings = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3,
                                          out_channels=embed_dim,
                                          kernel_size=patch_size,
                                          stride=patch_size)

        self.position_embeddings = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, self.num_patches, embed_dim))
        self.transformer = nn.TransformerEncoder(nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=embed_dim, nhead=8), num_layers=6)
```

**Note:** # Implementing the forward pass
In the `forward` method, we convert the image into patch embeddings, add positional embeddings, and pass it through the Transformer encoder.

```python
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.patch_embeddings(x)  # [B, embed_dim, H/patch_size, W/patch_size]
        x = x.flatten(2).transpose(1, 2)  # [B, num_patches, embed_dim]
        x = x + self.position_embeddings
        x = self.transformer(x)
        return x
```

**Note:** # Using the encoder
We instantiate the encoder and pass a dummy image to obtain the feature representations.

```python
encoder = MultiScaleViTEncoder()
input_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
features = encoder(input_image)
```

**Note:** # Checking the output
The shape of `features` should be `[1, num_patches, embed_dim]`, indicating that we have processed the image into a set of embeddings.

```python
# Print the shape of the features
print(features.shape)
```

## Lesson 3: Combining Real and Synthetic Data for Training

This lesson shows how combining real-world and synthetic datasets can improve the generalization of depth estimation models. We'll simulate training by combining data loaders.

**Note:** # Defining the RealWorldDataset class
We create a placeholder class for a real-world dataset. In practice, this would load actual images and depth maps.

```python
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class RealWorldDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize real-world dataset
        pass
    def __len__(self):
        return 1000
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        # Return an image and its depth map
        return torch.randn(3, 224, 224), torch.randn(224, 224)
```

**Note:** # Defining the SyntheticDataset class
Similarly, we create a class for a synthetic dataset.

```python
class SyntheticDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize synthetic dataset
        pass
    def __len__(self):
        return 1000
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        # Return an image and its depth map
        return torch.randn(3, 224, 224), torch.randn(224, 224)
```

**Note:** # Instantiating datasets
We create instances of both datasets.

```python
real_dataset = RealWorldDataset()
synthetic_dataset = SyntheticDataset()
```

**Note:** # Combining datasets
We combine the two datasets and create a data loader for training.

```python
combined_dataset = real_dataset + synthetic_dataset
combined_loader = DataLoader(combined_dataset, batch_size=16, shuffle=True)
```

**Note:** # Setting up training components
We define the model, optimizer, and loss function for training.

```python
model = MultiScaleViTEncoder()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
```

**Note:** # Training loop
We simulate a simple training loop where we process batches of images and depths, compute the loss, and update the model parameters.

```python
for epoch in range(5):
    for images, depths in combined_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        preds = model(images)
        loss = loss_fn(preds.squeeze(), depths)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

**Note:** # Indicating completion
We print a message after the training loop to indicate that training has finished.

```python
# Print a message
print('Training completed.')
```

## Lesson 4: Implementing Boundary Accuracy Metrics

In this lesson, we'll implement new metrics for evaluating the accuracy of depth boundaries. We'll focus on calculating the Boundary F1 Score.

**Note:** # Importing necessary modules
We need `torch` and `torch.nn.functional` for tensor operations.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
```

**Note:** # Defining a gradient function
This function computes the gradients of the depth map in the x and y directions. It's essential for identifying edges in the depth map.

```python
def gradient(x):
    h_x = x.size()[2]
    w_x = x.size()[3]
    left = x[:, :, 1:, :]
    right = x[:, :, :-1, :]
    top = x[:, :, :, 1:]
    bottom = x[:, :, :, :-1]
    dx = left - right
    dy = top - bottom
    dx = F.pad(dx, (0,0,0,1))
    dy = F.pad(dy, (0,1,0,0))
    return dx, dy
```

**Note:** # Implementing the Boundary F1 Score
We calculate the gradients of both the predicted and true depth maps to find edges. We then compute true positives, false positives, and false negatives to calculate precision, recall, and finally the F1 score.

Refer to **Section 3.2** of the paper where they introduce new metrics for boundary accuracy.

```python
def boundary_f1_score(pred_depth, true_depth, threshold=0.1):
    pred_dx, pred_dy = gradient(pred_depth)
    true_dx, true_dy = gradient(true_depth)
    pred_grad = torch.sqrt(pred_dx ** 2 + pred_dy ** 2)
    true_grad = torch.sqrt(true_dx ** 2 + true_dy ** 2)
    pred_boundary = pred_grad > threshold
    true_boundary = true_grad > threshold
    tp = (pred_boundary & true_boundary).float().sum()
    fp = (pred_boundary & (~true_boundary)).float().sum()
    fn = ((~pred_boundary) & true_boundary).float().sum()
    precision = tp / (tp + fp + 1e-8)
    recall = tp / (tp + fn + 1e-8)
    f1 = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall + 1e-8)
    return f1.item()
```

**Note:** # Testing the metric
We use random tensors to simulate depth maps and compute the Boundary F1 Score.

```python
# Example usage with dummy data
pred_depth = torch.randn(1, 1, 224, 224)
true_depth = torch.randn(1, 1, 224, 224)
f1_score = boundary_f1_score(pred_depth, true_depth)
print(f'Boundary F1 Score: {f1_score}')
```

## Lesson 5: Estimating Focal Length from a Single Image

In the final lesson, we'll implement a simple neural network to estimate the camera's focal length from a single image. We'll understand its importance in producing metric depth maps.

**Note:** # Defining the FocalLengthEstimator class
We create a simple convolutional neural network that processes the image and outputs a single value representing the focal length.

Refer to **Section 3.3** of the paper where they discuss focal length estimation.

```python
class FocalLengthEstimator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1)
        )
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32, 1)
```

**Note:** # Implementing the forward pass
The `forward` method applies the encoder to extract features and then uses a fully connected layer to predict the focal length.

```python
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.encoder(x)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        f = self.fc(x)
        return f
```

**Note:** # Using the estimator
We instantiate the estimator and pass a dummy image to get the estimated focal length.

```python
estimator = FocalLengthEstimator()
input_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
focal_length = estimator(input_image)
print(f'Estimated Focal Length: {focal_length.item()} pixels')
```

**Note:** # Setting up training components
We define a loss function and optimizer to train the focal length estimator.

```python
# Assume we have ground truth focal lengths
true_focal_lengths = torch.tensor([500.0])
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(estimator.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
```

**Note:** # Training the estimator
We simulate a training loop to optimize the estimator's parameters.

```python
for epoch in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    focal_length = estimator(input_image)
    loss = loss_fn(focal_length.squeeze(), true_focal_lengths)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

**Note:** # Observing improvement
After training, the estimator should provide a better estimate of the focal length.

```python
# Print the final estimated focal length
focal_length = estimator(input_image)
print(f'Estimated Focal Length after training: {focal_length.item()} pixels')
```

**Note:** # Using estimated focal length in depth estimation
The estimated focal length can be used to convert relative depth maps into metric depth maps by appropriately scaling them.

```python
# Integrate focal length into depth estimation
# depth_map = depth_network(image) / focal_length
```
